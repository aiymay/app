      <p>Since ancient times, Kazakh culture has paid special attention to the lineage of the bride and groom, as it affects the emergence of blood-lineage marriages. According to the Kazakh tradition people cannot get married to the representatives of a common kin, and also to the people who are less than seventh tribe of kin. This tradition was also beneficial for the health of future offspring. </p>

      Before the wedding ceremony in Kazakh culture, kudalyk (matchmaking) takes place. On the days before the wedding, matchmakers come to the bride's home, the purpose of their visit is to get to know the bride's close relatives and to arrange the girl's marriage. In the course of this tradition, the close relatives receive gifts from the guests. </p>

      <p>Afterwards, the next stage is kyz uzatu - send-off of the bride. A smaller number of guests from the groom's side are invited to this celebration. At the end of the celebration, a farewell song is sung by the bride's friends and relatives, this song is called "synsu". When it begins, the girl puts on a saukele, the bride's Kazakh headdress, and then she walks down a white walkway ("aq zhol"), which symbolizes happy marriage life. The day after the ceremony, the bride and her matchmakers leave for the groom's house.</p>

        <h2>Traditions related to gift-giving</h2>
        <p>In Kazakh culture there was a tradition of showing respect to a guest - "At mingizip shapan zhabu". An honoured guest, who is a highly respected person and has visited the village, is given a horse and an expensive chapan (camel hair outer garment with chintz lining) as a sign of recognition. In Kazakh tradition, baigazy is the giving of a gift to a younger person by an older person, most often given to children. In many cases this gift is given when children or young girls and boys buy new clothes. Adults giving baigazy say wishes and congratulations on the new items.</p>

      <p>During Nauryz, food is an integral part of the celebration. For our culture it was important to consider the number 7, as it symbolized the time units of universal eternity. One of the most important dishes was Nauryz-kozhe - soup, which was made of 7 ingredients: water, flour, meat, oil, millet, salt and milk. After cooking Nauryz-kozhe was poured into seven bowls and placed before elders-aksakals. </p>

        <h2>Traditions related to hospitality</h2>
        <p>One of the main traditions of the Kazakh people is hospitality. From ancient times, the culture has preserved the rule that says to welcome a guest as a messenger of God. That is why hospitality is a major necessity in the modern world. In ancient times, the inhabitants of the steppes always welcomed a guest cordially and tried to create favourable conditions for him. For this reason, travellers were sure that every Kazakh family would welcome him pleasantly on the road.</p>
